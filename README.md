# Temperature_monitoring
College project. 
The purpouse was to design the remote temperature monitoring system of goose eggs in incubators.

Over the years some researches was conducted to better understand the hatching of eggs of birds and the influence of various parameters on this process. In my work I focus on the preparation of the remote temperature measuring platform of the eggs of geese with analog sensor using the Raspberry Pi, development tools and open-source software. The precise temperature setting is a very important factor in the hatching of good quality, healthy chicks. Raspberry Pi is a low-cost mini-computer based on the ARM architecture designed to study computer science. The platform has been designed so that each authorized user has the opportunity to inspect the data stored on the server in the MySQL database for further analysis. The method involves continuously monitoring the temperature of goose eggs in an incubator at three different locations and the inside and outside of the eggshell.
